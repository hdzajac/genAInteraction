      'Milia-like cysts, fat fingers and a similar nodule next to the lesion suggest a diagnosis of Seb.k.',
      'The dermoscopic criteria and the history suggest a diagnosis of dermatofibroma.',
      'The rapid growth, clinical and dermoscopic presentation suggest a keratosis acanthoma.',
      'The clinical presentation is consistent with rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin condition',
      'The clinical presentation is consistent with perioral dermatitis, a common inflammatory facial dermatosis',
      'The clinical presentation is consistent with contact dermatitis, probably triggered by exposure to an irritant or allergenic substance, possibly related to the trip to the Philippines.',

    examplesLong: [
      'The differential diagnosis for the clinical picture is between Seb. K., nevus and melanoma. The presence of a similar lesion on the chest points to Seb. k. or nevus, as multiple melanomas are very rare in the same patient at the same time. Dermoscopically, no pigment network is seen, which speaks against nevus/melanoma, and there is a sharp demarcation, milia-like cysts and fat fingers, which are criteria for Seb. k. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Seb. k.',
      'The elevation and the slightly violet appearance on the overview image speak for dermatofibroma. Dermoscopy is also compatible with dermatofibroma, as a centrally radiating scar tissue-like area is seen in the background, under the pigment network they also radiate to the sides. There is no obvious differential diagnosis.',
      'The central hyperkeratosis with a surrounding wound edge and the absence of pigment network in the surrounding skin speaks for a keratoacanthoma. The history is also consistent with this tentative diagnosis, as keratoacanthomas typically present and grow rapidly.',
      "The clinical presentation is consistent with rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. The patient's symptoms, including facial erythema, flushing, and the presence of papules and pustules, are consistent with a diagnosis of papulopustular rosacea.",
      'The clinical presentation is consistent with perioral dermatitis, a common inflammatory facial dermatosis. Contributing factors may include recent discontinuation of oral contraceptives and use of over-the-counter topical steroids. Differential diagnoses such as acne vulgaris, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis are less likely given the specific distribution and morphology of the lesions.',
      'The clinical presentation is consistent with contact dermatitis, likely triggered by exposure to an irritant or allergenic substance, possibly related to the trip to the Philippines. This could be an allergen on clothing, during a shopping trip, or in hotel sheets.',

      'I would terminate the patient and encourage ongoing monitoring of other spots. It is important to point out at this point that the lesion will likely grow, become rougher and that it may "fall off" when the person takes a long bath and then dries himself with a towel.',
      'The lesion is completely peaceful and the patient can be reassured and terminated without follow-up. However, it would be a good idea to encourage ongoing sun prophylaxis and self-monitoring of lesions to prevent future cases of skin cancer.',
      'If you are comfortable with this, I recommend excision with a few mm margin and direct closure under local anesthesia. Closure should be performed in the longitudinal direction of the arm (proximal --> distal) to minimize traction in the wound.',
      'I would recommend topical treatment with metronidazole 0.75% gel 1-2 times daily for 3-4 months, can be extended if there is a positive effect and relapse. If there is no effect, consider starting at this point. in oral treatment with oracea (doxycycline 40 mg) once daily for 3 months. Recommend a daily mild cleanser and a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) to protect against UV-induced flare-ups.',
      'I would recommend that the patient stop all current facial products, including moisturizers, except for a mild, soap-free cleanser. In addition, I would start topical treatment with metronidazole 0.75% cream, applied twice daily. If ineffective, try oral treatment with doxycycline 100 mg orally once daily for 4-6 weeks.',
      'Apply a mild topical steroid, such as Betnovate (group III steroid) twice daily to the affected areas for up to 2 weeks. Recommend the use of a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times daily to protect the skin barrier. Advise the patient to switch to hypoallergenic washing and skin care products. And possibly to avoid clothing and other products from the Philippines that the person comes into contact with.',

      'I would encourage general self-monitoring of lesions and point out that this lesion will grow larger, which is normal, but that the person should keep an eye out for any changes in shape or new spots very close to it. Melaoma can develop right next to a sebaceous cyst.',
